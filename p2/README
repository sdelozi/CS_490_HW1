## Title
**Deep neural network based models to represent chromatin accessibility of hematopoietic cells and T-cells using ATAC-seq data**

## Abstract
Deciphering the interplay between genomic compaction and chromatin accessibility is crucial for comprehending cellular function. Chromatin accessibility reflects the intricate interactions of enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other DNA binding sites, ultimately shaping gene expression that may lead to protein production. This study delves into the chromatin accessibility profiles of hematopoietic cells and T cells. We leverage deep neural networks to model these accessibility patterns, utilizing ATAC-seq data as the foundation for our analysis. Our findings aim to illuminate the regulatory landscapes governing these vital cell types.
